 # Qiskit Quantum Computing Projects

This repository contains five simple exciting quantum computing projects implemented using Qiskit,
the open-source quantum computing framework developed by IBM. Each project showcases different aspects of quantum computing and
provides an opportunity to explore the power of qubits, quantum gates, and quantum algorithms.

## Projects

1. Quantum Coin Flipper: Create a quantum coin flipper that demonstrates the superposition of quantum states, allowing the coin to be in both heads and tails simultaneously.

2. Quantum Cryptography Lock: Build a quantum cryptography lock that utilizes quantum key distribution to encrypt and decrypt messages, ensuring secure communication channels.

3. Quantum Maze Solver: Develop a quantum maze solver that employs Grover's search algorithm to find the optimal path through a maze by leveraging quantum superposition and interference.

4. Quantum Machine Learning: Explore the intersection of quantum computing and machine learning by building a quantum classifier using feature maps and quantum support vector machines (QSVM).

5. Quantum Entangled Game: Engage in a quantum entangled game where players manipulate qubits to match a target entangled state, offering a fun and interactive way to understand quantum entanglement.
